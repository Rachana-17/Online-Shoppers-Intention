# Online Shopper Intention Analysis

This project leverages machine learning to analyze online shopper behaviors and intentions using the Online Shoppers Intention dataset. By performing feature engineering and classification modeling, the project aims to predict revenue generation and identify key factors influencing e-commerce transactions.

## Project Overview

E-commerce platforms generate vast amounts of user data that can be analyzed to uncover trends and insights, ultimately helping to optimize marketing and user experience strategies. This project investigates the attributes of online shopping sessions to classify transactions based on their revenue generation potential.

## Dataset

The [Online Shoppers Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset) contains various features related to user behavior, session information, and revenue labels. The data file (`online_shoppers_intention.csv`) is included in this repository.

# Project Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized the dataset for optimal performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted informative features to improve the model's ability to predict revenue generation.
- **Modeling**: Built and evaluated classification models to determine which session attributes are most predictive of revenue.
- **Analysis**: Visualized results to interpret the significant factors influencing e-commerce transactions.

# Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language used for the project
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating classification models
- **Visualization Libraries**: Used for data exploration and analysis (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Results
The classification models were trained to predict whether a session would generate revenue based on session attributes, revealing insights into factors that most impact purchasing behavior in online shopping.

# Getting Started
To explore the analysis and results:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Online-Shopper-Intention-Analysis.git
